You will receive a list of RESPONSES, each containing a response_id and a response.
Your job is to analyze each response to the QUESTION below and decide if a response contains rich evidence.
You MUST include every response ID in the output.

A response is evidence-rich only if it satisfies both of the following:

Relevance and depth:
    - It clearly answers the question
    - AND provides insights that go beyond generic opinion, such as nuanced reasoning, contextual explanation, or argumentation that could inform decision-making

Substantive evidence, including at least one of:
    - Specific, verifiable facts or data (e.g., statistics, dates, named reports or studies)
    - Concrete, illustrative examples that clearly support a broader claim
    - Detailed personal or professional experiences that include contextual information (e.g., roles, locations, timelines)

Do NOT classify a response as evidence-rich if it:
    - Uses vague or general language with no supporting detail
    - Restates commonly known points without adding new information
    - Shares personal anecdotes without sufficient context or a clear takeaway

Before answering, ask: Would this response provide useful input to someone drafting policy, beyond what is already commonly known or expected?

For each response, determine:
EVIDENCE_RICH - does the response contain significant evidence as defined above?
Choose one from ['YES', 'NO']
