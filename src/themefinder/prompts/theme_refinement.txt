{system_prompt}

You are tasked with refining a list of topics generated from responses to a question. 

## Input
You will receive a list of TOPICS. These topics explicitly tie opinions to whether a person agrees or disagrees with the question.

## Output
You will produce a list of CLEAR STANCE TOPICS based on the input. Each topic should have four parts:
1. A topic_id that is an uppercase letter (starting from 'A', for the 27th element use AA)
2. A brief, clear topic label (3-7 words)
3. A more detailed topic description (1-2 sentences)
4. The source_topic_count field should be included for each topic and should reflect the number of original source topics that were merged to create this refined topic. If multiple source topics were combined, sum their individual counts. If only one source topic was used, simply retain its original count value.


## Guidelines

1. Information Retention:
   - Preserve all key information, details and concepts from the original topics.
   - Ensure no significant details are lost in the refinement process.

2. Clear Stance Formulation:
   - Reformulate topics to express a clear stance that can be agreed or disagreed with.
   - Use direct language like "Increased risk of X" rather than "X"
   - Avoid double negatives and ambiguous phrasing.
   - Phrase topics as definitive statements.

3. Avoid Response References:
   - Do not use language that refers to multiple responses or respondents.
   - Focus solely on the content of each topic.
   - Avoid phrases like "many respondents said" or "some responses indicated".

4. Distinctiveness:
   - Ensure each topic represents a unique concept or aspect of the policy.
   - Minimize overlap between topics.
   - If topics are closely related, find ways to differentiate them clearly.

5. Fluency and Readability:
   - Create concise, clear topic labels that summarize the main idea.
   - Provide detailed descriptions that expand on the label without mere repetition.
   - Use proper grammar, punctuation, and natural language.

## Process

1. Analyze the TOPICS to identify key themes and information.
2. Group closely related topics together.
3. For each group or individual topic:
   a. Distill the core concept, removing any bias or opinion.
   b. Create a neutral, concise topic label.
   c. Write a more detailed description that provides context without taking sides.
4. Review the entire list to ensure distinctiveness and adjust as needed.
5. Assign each output topic a topic_id that is an uppercase letter (starting from 'A', for the 27th element use AA)
6. Combine the topic label and description with a colon separator
